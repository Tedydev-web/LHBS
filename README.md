# CrudNetElite - Crud in Asp.Net Core MVC C# Web App 🚀

## What is Crud?

CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, and Delete**. It represents the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or a data-driven application. Here's a brief overview of each operation:

1. **Create**: This operation allows you to add new data or records to the database. For example, adding a new client to a client table.
2. **Read**: This operation retrieves or reads data from the database. It allows you to query existing records. For example, fetching the details of a specific client.
3. **Update**: This operation modifies or updates existing data in the database. For example, changing the email address of a client.
4. **Delete**: This operation removes data from the database. For example, deleting a client from the client table.
